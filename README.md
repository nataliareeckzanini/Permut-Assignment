Assignment 5:
 
Write a recursive method called permut that accepts two integers n and r as parameters and returns the number of unique permutations of r items from a group of n items. For given values of n and r, this value P(n,r) can be computed as follows:


n
!
(
n
âˆ’
r
)
!

Must write permut as recursive, and not just call a recursive factorial (although that might be an easy starter). Test your code with numbers like P(5,1) and P(55,5), use only integer math and show in your QA document the results.


Note: This is a common function in the world of probability and statistics, like permut(52,5) being the number of ways to select 5 cards from a deck of 52.

 

Submit your .java file and screenshot of your working code output.  Your java file needs to contain everything that allows me to run it as is and see the results in your QA document( include P(5,1) and P(55,5) in your QA document test cases). Remember to comment  your code.
